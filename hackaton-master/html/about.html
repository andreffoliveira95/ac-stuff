            <p>With 1.5 years of experience in the pharmaceutical sector and starting my career in IT. <br> I'm highly motivated to seek new challenges and to be successful in any project I'm involved in. <br> I'm specially interested in web development
                to help you boost your online presence. I consider myself an ambitious, cooperative, hardworking, persistent,<br> responsible and rigorous person. Moreover, one of my missions is to accelerate the transition to a more digital, efficient
                and, therefore, economically sustainable healthcare. Driven to make an impact.</p>

            <p>I've climbed some mountains, I've surfed some waves, now I want to write code. <br> Take advantage of this passion for software development and turn my professional life into something I've been looking for a long time. <br> Like all the challenges
                and adventures I've experienced, I face this one with even more energy and desire to revolutionize the world of code. <br> Shall we climb the next "mountain" together?</p>

            <p>I have been doing theater since I was six years old. <br> I have acted for thousands of people. Thousands of people have applauded me, thousands of people have cried with me, thousands of people have smiled with me.
                <br> Many emotions have been shared. Now it's time to program. <br> To create code for the programmer's big stage. Making code is an art. Let's make programing art?</p>

            <p>Having worked as a forkliftOperator in a glass factory for 2 years has helped me reinforce the concept that repetition makes perfection, I also learned the importance and benefits of keeping stress levels down. <br> After my son was born,
                I started to want more for myself and my family. So I needed to learn something new that would help me accomplish that. <br> That's where I turned to programming @
                <Academia de Codigo_>, and I believe it was one of the best decisions in my life. As a parent I found that teaching a son and learning to code are quite similar. <br> Repetition, falling on your head sometimes && having fun are some of the skills I believe
                    to be crucial in order to overcome everyday programming problems.</p>

            <p>As a really passionate Skater, my persistence has always been my middle name, and since involving myself with IT since the late 80s, I've always been loyal to my good'ol friends , the Personal Computers!
                <br> Always looking forward to new challenges, friends and knowledge. <br> My skate life has always taught me to always get up after falling down and never give up, and I think this can refer to my programming life as well. <br> These
                past few years I've been involved and connected to the wonderfully diverse world of Programming, be it Front End or Back End, I've been "grinding and sliding" through it, so I'm no stranger with concepts and names like Java, Javascript,
                mySql, HTML, CSS or Git. <br> Currently I'm finishing one of my lifetime experiences doing a FullStack Bootcamp with Academia de Código and soon will be BACK even Stronger!</p>
