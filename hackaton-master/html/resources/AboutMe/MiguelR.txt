Having worked as a forkliftOperator in a glass factory for 2 years has helped me reinforce the concept that repetition makes perfection, I also learned the importance and benefits of keeping stress levels down.
After my son was born, I started to want more for myself and my family. So I needed to learn something new that would help me accomplish that. That's where I turned to programming @<Academia de Codigo_>, and I believe it was one of the best decisions in my life. 
As a parent I found that teaching a son and learning to code are quite similar. Repetition, falling on your head sometimes && having fun are some of the skills I believe to be crucial in order to overcome everyday programming problems.
