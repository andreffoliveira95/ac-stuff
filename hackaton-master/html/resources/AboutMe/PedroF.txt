As a really passionate Skater, my persistence has always been my middle name, and since involving myself with IT since the late 80s, I've always been loyal to my good'ol friends , the Personal Computers!
Always looking forward to new challenges, friends and knowledge.

My skate life has always taught me to always get up after falling down and never give up, and I think this can refer to my programming life as well.

These past few years I've been involved and connected to the wonderfully diverse world of Programming, be it Front End or Back End, I've been "grinding and sliding" through it, so I'm no stranger with concepts and names like Java, Javascript, mySql, HTML, CSS or Git.

Currently I'm finishing one of my lifetime experiences doing a FullStack Bootcamp with Academia de CÃ³digo and soon will be BACK even Stronger!
